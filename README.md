# py-impl-benchmarking
for a school sci project\
i used pypy 2.7 v7.3.3, jython 2.7.2 (and AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.9.1), cpython 2.7.18, ironpython 2.7.11 (and .NET 5.0.100)\
like any decent programmer i copypasted and then slightly adjusted the calculating pi code from [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45113790/calculating-pi-to-the-nth-digit)\
aaaaand the n-body simulation stuff was taken from [here](pybenchmarks.org/u64q/program.php?test=nbody&lang=python&id=1)
